# ⚠️ DISCLAIMER
This _IS NOT_ an example of good quality code. 

This was one of the first websites I ever wrote (circa 2010 before any formal CS training), and I have archived it here for posterity. 

Please DO NOT use this as a reference for how I currently write code, or what a modern website should be.
